# fragchain
Fragment shader chaining for Unity.

This software allows you to render a chain of fragment shaders to png files. There are Python scripts included to compile those into gifs and mp4s (requires Imagemagick, ffmpeg, and gifsicle).

Each fragment shader pass defines it's set of float uniforms which can be controlled via midi. Basic support for saving / loading presets for the float parameters plus camera position.
